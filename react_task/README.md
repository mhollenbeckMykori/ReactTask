Hello, and welcome to the mykori React coding task! :)

1. The Project does not compile right now. Can you fix the problem?
2. The correct name is not displayed in the greeting. Instead it says "props.name". Can you fix the issue?
3. The logo on the Website is way too big. Can you make it smaller?
4. Right now, online one big component is being used. Can you split the component in at least two components, so the are reusable?

If you are done, you can make your own branch, and push the changes. 
We are exited to meet you tomorrow!
